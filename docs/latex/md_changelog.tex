Notable changes to this project will be tracked here. Additions, deprecations, etc. are described per version release.\hypertarget{md_changelog_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\mbox{[}3.\+0.\+0\mbox{]} -\/ 2022-\/06}\label{md_changelog_autotoc_md1}
Version 3.\+0.\+0, a preliminary release, is a major overhaul of the testbed. Most prominently, V2\+Verifier is now a C++ project. Several factors informed the change from Python to C++; most significantly, V2\+Verifier code now runs at speeds much closer to real V2V software and therefore more accurately reflects real-\/world performance (e.\+g., ECDSA verifications are performed) at a more realistic pace.

{\bfseries{While we await bug fixes in third-\/pary software that our C-\/\+V2X transceiver relies on, we have {\itshape temporarily} removed C-\/\+V2X support.}} Please see the README for details. Version 3.\+0.\+1 will be released in the near future as a hotfix to restore C-\/\+V2X support.\hypertarget{md_changelog_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{Added}\label{md_changelog_autotoc_md2}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item C++ implementations of all V2\+Verifier files.
\item Support for GNURadio version 3.\+8 
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_changelog_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{Changed}\label{md_changelog_autotoc_md3}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item V2\+Verifier is now a C++ project
\item Tk\+GUI is now a standalone utility included with the project that can be run alongside, but not as a direct part of, the main C++ code.
\item C-\/\+V2X is temporarily not supported pending bug fixes in third-\/party source code that this project relies on. 
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_changelog_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{Fixed}\label{md_changelog_autotoc_md4}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Sidelink communication (C-\/\+V2X) in V2\+Verifier based on the srs\+RAN project (\href{https://github.com/twardokus/v2verifier/issues/34}{\texttt{ issue \#34}}) was fixed by srs\+RAN developers (see that project\textquotesingle{}s \href{https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN/issues/838}{\texttt{ issue \#838}}). 
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_changelog_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{Deprecated}\label{md_changelog_autotoc_md5}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item All Python-\/based versions of V2\+Verifier ($<$3.\+0) are no longer supported.
\item GNURadio 3.\+7 is no longer supported. 
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_changelog_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{Removed}\label{md_changelog_autotoc_md6}

\begin{DoxyItemize}

V2\+Verifier 2.\+0 introduced several major changes including support for C-\/\+V2X and additional IEEE 1609.\+2 features. \hypertarget{md_changelog_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsection{Added}\label{md_changelog_autotoc_md8}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Implicit certificate and certificate digest structures (see IEEE 1609.\+2 Section 6.\+4) are now included with V2\+Verifier messages. $\ast$\+\_\+\+Note that full cryptographic support for certificate generation and verification, including 1609.\+2 pseudonym generation and linkage, is not yet included but is currently under active development\+\_\+.
\item A new, browser-\/based GUI (built with Java\+Script as an Electron app) features a Google Maps integration and support for GNSS-\/based vehicle locations.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This facilitates more realistic experiments
\item Better suited to research activities than the existing Tkinter GUI (which remains suitable for instructional use)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Real-\/time message generation and transmission replace pre-\/generated message queues in versions $<$= 1.\+1
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Compliant with IEEE 1609.\+2 Section 6.\+3.\+9 (regarding the {\ttfamily generation\+Time} field)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Support for receiving C-\/\+V2X messages from commercial off-\/the-\/shelf C-\/\+V2X devices (\href{https://github.com/twardokus/v2verifier/commits/master?before=8655d3f1db9c398f9496732a3307af6d7617fb92+70&branch=master}{\texttt{ commit \#b35898d}})
\item A fully functional C-\/\+V2X {\itshape receiver} (full SDR-\/to-\/\+SDR C-\/\+V2X support is in the final stages of development)
\item Basic reputation tracking had been added. \mbox{\hyperlink{classVehicle}{Vehicle}} reputation starts at a customizable value (default 1000) and degrades over time with security failures like signature verification failure or transmission of expired messages
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This is a starting point for evaluating reputation-\/based misbehavior detection systems
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The existing Tk-\/based GUI now features a \char`\"{}threat tracking\char`\"{} interface to allow at-\/a-\/glance understanding of vehicle location/motion information within a scenario
\item Files and documentation to execute a message replay attack in DSRC are now included with the testbed code
\item The project has been significantly restructured. V2\+Verifier can now be imported as a module, facilitating maximum portability and integration with other open-\/source projects.
\item V2\+Verifier can now be run as pure simulation if access to software-\/defined radios is not available
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This is ideal for testing and development as well as in situations where equipment is limited 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_changelog_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsection{Changed}\label{md_changelog_autotoc_md9}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item V2\+Verifier no longer requires root permissions (i.\+e., {\ttfamily sudo}-\/ing commands is no longer required)
\item Several instances of object-\/oriented design converted to straightforward functions, reducing system resource consumption and improving performance
\item Socket communication between testbed components now uses TCP instead of UDP for more reliable (and faster) communication 
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_changelog_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsection{Fixed}\label{md_changelog_autotoc_md10}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Resolve issue with GUI not launching that originated with Python 3.\+6/3.9 differences in keyword argument handling
\item Verification failures due to dropping the leading zero in some ECDSA signatures have been resolved (\href{https://github.com/twardokus/v2verifier/commit/648b11883d4f4b71055d84c9cfc6b1c548654160}{\texttt{ commit \#648b118}}) 
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_changelog_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysubsection{Deprecated}\label{md_changelog_autotoc_md11}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Scapy-\/based listeners are no longer supported and receivers based on this implementation may not work properly with the updated transmitter 
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_changelog_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysubsection{Removed}\label{md_changelog_autotoc_md12}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item long-\/defunct unified DSRC flowgraph file has been removed
\item a large number of files dating back to version 0.\+9, and long-\/since unused, have been removed
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_changelog_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysection{\mbox{[}1.\+1\mbox{]} -\/ 2020-\/11-\/13}\label{md_changelog_autotoc_md13}
V2\+Verifier 1.\+1 was a minor update focused on cleaning up the code base and adding minimal support documentation, e.\+g., how to run the software.\hypertarget{md_changelog_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysubsection{Added}\label{md_changelog_autotoc_md14}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item terminal interface and option to use console interaction instead of GUI during program execution
\item loopback interface from GNURadio to facilitate experimentation and development without software-\/defined radios
\item placeholders added for certificate structures to ensure realistic packet size 
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_changelog_autotoc_md15}{}\doxysubsection{Changed}\label{md_changelog_autotoc_md15}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item README updated to add instructions for reactive jamming attack and clarify usage of the software in general
\item Pre-\/specifying the number of packets to be sent during simulation (in the configuration file) is no longer required for accurate statistical reporting in GUI
\item Tx/\+Rx flowgraph defaults adjusted to reduce need for end-\/user tinkering with SDR parameters. This significantly reduces the packet error rate at frequencies approaching 6 GHz, especially on less capable SDRs (e.\+g., USRP B210)
